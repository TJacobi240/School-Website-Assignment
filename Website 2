		<h3 id="Sloped_Armour">Sloped Armour</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>Sloped armour is effectively angling the armour of a tank on an angle rather than placed for a flat surface.
		<br>
		Slope armour presents the advantage of having a much thicker effective armour on a tanks for a lighter weight due to using a thinner armour plate. The sloped nature also increases the chance of the impacting shell to simply ricochet or deflect off, doing no effect to the armour. The disadvantage of the sloped armour was its more complicated manufacturing process and a reduction in internal space.</p>
		<hr>

		
		<h3 id="Armour_Angling">Armour Angling</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>Outside of sloped armour, another way to improve the effective armour thickness on tanks is simply angling the armour towards the opponent. This means instead of sloping the armour in a vertical plane, instead angle sideways.
			<br><br>
		This gives another form of thickness as not only does the round have to pass through a plane of armour, but two plane of the same armour, which would boost the effective thickness. This is best seen in vertical-faced armoured tanks like the Tiger I tank. Though their vertical faced 100 mm front plate would only give 100 mm effectiveness, it was recommended in the Tigerfibel crew manual that a 45 degree diamond angle position would provide a front armour of nearly 130 mm of effective thickness.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h3 id="Spaced_Armour">Spaced Armour</h3>
		<hr>

		<p>Spaced armour helps against anti-tank rounds in a form of disruption and denial. Spaced armour was first widely used by the Germans in the form of "Schürzen", attaching metal sheets away from the base armour of their Panzers.<br><br> These metal sheets were intended to disrupt the kinetic energy of the Soviet 14.5 mm anti-tank rifles, which could penetrate the weaker side armour of their tanks. It does this by forcing much of the energy on the rifle round to be expelled on the Schürzen sheets, passing through and causing negligible damage on the base side armour. The Schürzen may also disrupt tank rounds as well, but the much greater kinetic energy of tank shells means that its disruption will be ineffective to all but the most sloped shots. Though there is a belief that the Schürzen plates were meant to stop HEAT rounds from shoulder-launched weapons, the plates were not intentionally designed for this task.</p>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="ERA">Explosive Reactive Armour</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>Explosive reactive armour (ERA) works by using an explosive force to disrupt an incoming armour-piercing ammunition. The construction of ERA usually takes the form of individual tiles made up of "reactive elements", which are sandwiched explosives in between sheets of metal. These tiles would be used around vulnerable points of a tank to provide protection at these locations.
		<br><br>
		Though ERA provides good protection against HEAT ammunition, high-velocity kinetic penetrators like APDS and APFSDS penetrates too quickly for the explosive force to be effective against them. This was a problem in early ERA designs, but more modern ERA types have been able to resist these ammunition. Even so, ERA still has drawbacks in that each explosive tile were one-time-use against the incoming round, leaving the exposed tank metal underneath once expended. ERA also has become vulnerable to tandem-charge ammunition, which use a two-stage detonation sequence with the first charge destroying the ERA plate and the second penetrating the armour underneath the plate. Finally, the ERA plates rarely cover the entire tank sections due to contouring and moving parts, so the armour is still exposed in various degrees to be hit and penetrated.</p>

		<h3>Additional Info</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>All of the information is gathered from the official <a href="https://wiki.warthunder.com/Main_Page">War Thunder Wiki</a>. <br><br> Each Armour has their own strengths and weaknessess like ERA being strong against Chemical Rounds, so over the decades of innovation there has been combanations and new developmetnts, by far the most used today is ERA plating on top of Spaced Composite Armour. Spaced composite armour is spaced armour but with ceramic balls, steel barings or other various materials inbetween armour plates.</p>
